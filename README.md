## About Me :sunglasses:
My name is Loveish Sarolia, and I am a rising sophomore at Virginia Tech pursuing a B.S. in Computational Modeling and Data Analytics as well as a B.A. in Economics.

I'm originally from a small town in Mississippi, and I strive to do great things while putting an emphasis on helping where I came from. I love to learn and work with all kinds of data to create accessible visualizations and aid in data decision-making processes. I enjoy being busy and applying my skills to a variety of projects to support the needs of the group or company I'm working with.
